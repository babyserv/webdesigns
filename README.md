# Comic Strip Layout Website

This project is a playful comic strip inspired layout. Open `index.html` in your browser to see panels for **About**, **Recipes**, and **Blog**. Hover over panels to reveal speech bubbles, click a panel to flip into that section, and watch for random sarcastic thought bubbles.
